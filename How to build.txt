The build script assumes that you have git.exe on your environment path. 
	(e.g.: C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\cmd )
	for instructions on how to set your path

The build script is unsigned so you will have to enable unsigned scripts to run as follows:

	open a PowerShell window as administrator and run this command:
	Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted

In order to build this project, you need to execute the psake build script from the PowerShell console.
You do this using the following command from the root project directory:

	.\psake.ps1 default.ps1 Compile

To run the tests call:

	.\psake.ps1 default.ps1
	
Note: Running the tests requires access to a database called 'test' on the default instance of SQL Server
	otherwise the tests will hang.
